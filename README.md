# MakeMeUpzz
MakeMeUpzz is a project from my Pattern Software Design course Laboratory. It is a makeup marketplace website with a simple front end. This project used the ASP.NET Web Application Framework, which incorporates ASPX for the front end, C# for the back end, MySQL for the database, and SAP Crystal Report for reporting.

Highlights:
- Authentication (Login & Register)
- user Cookie & Session 
- Role-Based Access Control
- Database CRUD Operation
- Domain Driven Design Concepts (MVC)
- Factory Method Design Pattern
